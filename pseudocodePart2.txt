1. Import required libraries (stdio, math, and stdlib) and the "roots.h" header file.
2. Define a Complex struct with two float members: real and imag.
3. Define functions to compute_c1, compute_c2, and compute_theta using given formulas.
4. In the main function:
   a. Open "Data.txt" for reading and check if the file was opened successfully.
   b. Open "Result.txt" for writing and check if the file was created successfully.
   c. Create variables a1, a2, y0, and y1.
   d. Loop through the lines of "Data.txt" and read the values of a1, a2, y0, and y1.
      i. Call the find_roots function to find the roots of the given values.
      ii. Check if the roots are real or complex.
         1. If the roots are real and equal, compute C1 and C2 for repeating real roots, and write the result to "Result.txt".
         2. If the roots are real and distinct, compute C1 and C2 for distinct real roots, and write the result to "Result.txt".
         3. If the roots are complex conjugates, compute C and theta for complex conjugate roots, and write the result to "Result.txt".
   e. Close the input and output files.
   f. Print a message indicating that the results have been saved to "Result.txt".
5. End the main function.
