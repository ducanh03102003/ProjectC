1. Define a Complex struct with real and imaginary parts as float.
2. Declare function signatures:
   - compute_c1(a1, a2, y0, y1, lambda1, lambda2)
   - compute_c2(a1, a2, y0, y1, lambda1, lambda2)
   - compute_theta(alpha, beta, y0, y1)
   - find_roots(a1, a2, root1, root2)
3. Implement compute_c1, compute_c2, and compute_theta functions with given formulas.
4. Implement the main function:
   a. Read a1, a2, y0, and y1 from user input.
   b. Call find_roots to get root1 and root2.
   c. Check the type of roots (real or complex) and handle them accordingly:
      i.   Repeating real roots: Calculate C1 and C2 and print the solution.
      ii.  Distinct real roots: Calculate C1 and C2 and print the solution.
      iii. Complex conjugate roots: Calculate C, theta, and print the solution.
5. Implement the find_roots function:
   a. Calculate the discriminant.
   b. Depending on the discriminant value, find the roots:
      i.   Positive discriminant: Find two distinct real roots.
      ii.  Zero discriminant: Find one real root (repeated).
      iii. Negative discriminant: Find two complex conjugate roots.
